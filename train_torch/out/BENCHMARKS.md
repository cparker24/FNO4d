# FNO model benchmarks (as of 2026-10-07)

Reference point before investigating model capacity. All same-initial-state
comparisons use seed=424242 at 30-40% centrality (`xmls/AuAu_50ev_30-40.xml`'s
generation seed; same seed re-used for the X-SCAPE live-test configs so the
FNO and MUSIC arms see an identical MCGlauber/MUSIC-primed initial
condition). All FNO-arm numbers are post the two normalization-bug fixes in
`js-contrib` commit `91c4177` (forward-normalize the primed IC; stop
denormalizing in place in `BuildNextWindowIC`).

## Training runs

| Run | Events | tauslice | n_epochs | Final eval l2 | Peak CUDA | Total time | Checkpoint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 200 (0-10/10-20/20-30/30-40, 50 each) | 100 | 30 | 0.969 (epoch 28) | 21.15 GB | 3488s | superseded |
| B | 400 (100 each) | 70 | 30 | **0.627** (epoch 28) | 17.44 GB | 5627s | **current best by training loss** |
| C (capacity: n_modes tau 16->32, 570M params vs B's 302M) | 400 (100 each) | 70 | 30 | 0.638 (epoch 28) | 21.44 GB | 6526s | superseded -- no improvement |

Run B's eval-loss curve is also qualitatively cleaner (smooth decrease,
1.24->0.627) vs run A's noisier one -- more data clearly helps the training
metric. See `epoch_scan_50ep/README.md` for the separate finding that ~30
epochs is the overfitting onset at this data scale (established before run
B's data expansion; not re-verified at 400 events).

## Same-IC fidelity vs real MUSIC (seed=424242, 30-40% centrality)

Three FNO versions compared against one real full-dynamical MUSIC run
(`music_cen30_40_event0.csv` / `fno_vs_music_cen3040/music_peak_temperature.csv`,
froze out at tau=8.76 fm/c):

| FNO version | Peak T (tau~0.5) | Mid-evolution (tau 2-6) | Freeze-out crossing | Post-freeze-out artifact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-fix (buggy input norm) | 494 MeV (MUSIC: 381) -- **over**-predicts | stays ~30-100+ MeV hotter than MUSIC throughout | never (still ~168 MeV at window end) | none observed (never gets there) |
| Run A (200 ev, tau=100) | 346 MeV -- close | runs ~20-40 MeV **cooler** than MUSIC | tau~6.8 (MUSIC: 8.76) -- early | dips to ~65-75 MeV then partially recovers, tau~9 |
| Run B (400 ev, tau=70) | 341 MeV -- close | **same under-prediction as run A**, no improvement | tau~6.7 (window ends tau~7.3, too short to compare tail) | smaller dip (~95-100 MeV), earlier, shorter window to observe it in |
| Run C (capacity: tau-modes=32) | 310 MeV -- close | **tracks run B almost exactly, no improvement** | tau~6.7, same as run B | same pattern as run B, no change |

**Headline finding: expanding training data 2x and shrinking tauslice from
100->70 did not close the mid-evolution cooling-rate gap, and neither did
nearly doubling model capacity (run C, 570M vs 302M params, tau-axis
Fourier modes 16->32) targeted specifically at the temporal-resolution
hypothesis.** Runs A, B, and C all track each other almost exactly relative
to MUSIC -- run C's eval l2 (0.638) wasn't even measurably better than run
B's (0.627). This is a fairly decisive negative result: the mid-evolution
gap is not a capacity bottleneck in this dimension. Whatever's driving it
is more likely the loss function's behavior in this regime, the
normalization scheme's structure, a systematic bias in the training data
itself, or a genuine limitation of this model class/training setup rather
than something more data or more parameters fixes.

## Post-fix 20-event centrality sweep (run A checkpoint, before run B existed)

5 events each at 0-10/10-20/20-30/30-40% centrality, fixed-normalization
model (run A). All 20 reached freeze-out within the native window --
confirms the normalization fix wasn't a one-centrality fluke. Final
temperatures at the window's last step (tau~10.34 fm/c):

| Centrality | Final T range |
|---|---|
| 0-10% | 100.6 - 115.7 MeV |
| 10-20% | 81.8 - 103.8 MeV |
| 20-30% | 82.0 - 86.0 MeV |
| 30-40% | 68.1 - 74.5 MeV |

Physically sensible ordering (hotter/most-central finishes closest to
threshold). Every one of the 20 curves showed the same post-freeze-out
dip-and-recover artifact (likely Gibbs-ringing from the hard zero-padding
edge in training targets past each event's own freeze-out -- see
conversation history for the ed/T co-variation check that ruled out the
EOS conversion as the source). Data: `centrality_sweep_fixed_norm/`,
overlay plot `centrality_sweep_fixed_norm/sweep_all_centralities_vs_music.png`.

## Training data (as of run B)

100 clean events per centrality bin (400 total), validated via the
`ntau_freezeout` filter (`min_ntau_freezeout: 10` in config.yaml, added to
`train_torch.py` after discovering MUSIC/ROOT-writer crashes left blank
events in the first generation attempt -- see `js-contrib`/X-SCAPE commit
history around Oct 6-7 2026 for the ROOT `TFile::Flush()` fix):
- `AuAu_100ev_0_10-1.root` (100 events)
- `AuAu_50ev_10_20-1.root` + `-2` (100 events)
- `AuAu_50ev_20_30-1.root` + `-2` (100 events)
- `AuAu_50ev_30_40-1.root` + `-2` (100 events)

## Open issue carried forward

Mid-evolution (tau 2-6 fm/c) systematic under-prediction of ~20-40 MeV
relative to real MUSIC, consistent across data scale (runs A/B) and model
capacity (run C) -- capacity is now ruled out as the driver. Next
candidates: loss function behavior in this regime, the normalization
scheme's structure, or a systematic training-data bias (e.g. whether the
training targets themselves, taken from MUSIC's own output, show the same
mid-evolution values the live comparison expects -- worth directly
checking a training-set event's ground truth against this same metric
before assuming the model is at fault rather than a data/eval mismatch).
